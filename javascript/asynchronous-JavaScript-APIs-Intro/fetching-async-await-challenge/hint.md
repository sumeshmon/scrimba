Fetch the full url and store what you get back to a const called "response".

Set up a const "data" and store what you get from converting your "response" to a JS object.

If you get unexpected errors, check index.html to see if you are working in a module or not. Also make sure you are using the "async" and "await" keywords in the right places!
